<h1>Music scale identifier</h1>
A program to quickly identify scales based on notes

<h2>What is this project?</h2>
This project was built to quickly identify possible scales a collection of notes belong to as I was too lazy to go on the internet to do so. So instead I spent a good hour making this. This was made just for fun.

<h2>What does the program do?</h2>
The program takes user input and outputs the matching scale or in the case of an imperfect match, the top 3 scales. It is currently limited to the modern heptatonic major scales.
The program is quite simple so feel free to alter it to your liking.

<h2>How to run the program?</h2>
<h3>Windows</h3>
Simply download the mainW.exe executable and run it. The program should work correctly.
<h3>Linux</h3>
Simply download the mainL.exe executable and run it. The program should work correctly.
If you decide to alter the code, you can build it again by running the makefile using make. The new executable should be created as program.exe.
