<h1>Music scale identifier</h1>
A program to quickly identify scales based on notes

<h2>What is this project?</h2>
This project was built to quickly identify possible scales a collection of notes belong to as I was too lazy to go on the internet to do so. So instead I spent a good hour making this. This was made just for fun.

<h2>What does the program do?</h2>
The program takes user input and outputs the matching scale or in the case of an imperfect match, the top 3 scales. It is currently limited to the modern heptatonic major scales.
The program is quite simple so feel free to alter it to your liking.

<h2>How to run the program?</h2>
<h3>Windows</h3>
Simply download the main.exe executable and run it. The program should work correctly.
<h3>Linux</h3>
Download main.cpp, main.h and Makefile. Put them into one folder and then run make. Afterwards, the executable should be available as newMainLinux.exe.
