<h1>Music scale identifier</h1>
A program to quickly identify scales based on notes

<h2>What is this project?</h2>
This project was built to quickly identify possible scales a collection of notes belong to as I found the websites on the internet a bit slow and clumsy. So instead I spent a good hour making this. This was made just for fun.

<h2>What does the program do?</h2>
The program takes user input and outputs the matching scale or in the case of an imperfect match, the top 3 scales. It is currently limited to the modern heptatonic major scales.
The program is quite simple so feel free to alter it to your liking.

<h2>How to run the program?</h2>
<h3>Windows</h3>
Simply download the mainWindows.exe executable and run it. The program should work correctly.
<h3>Linux</h3>
Simply download the mainLinux.exe executable and run it. The program should work correctly. 
If you want to alter the program, then download main.cpp, main.h and Makefile. Put them into one folder and then run make. Afterwards, the executable should be available as newMainLinux.exe.
